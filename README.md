Usage
=====
This is not safe to use.  Therefore, it is not easy to run.  Here are the general steps:

1) Run Trader Workstation, enable local API access
2) Set up auth.yaml -- if you aren't sure what it looks like or how to find out, 
   you almost certainly should not be running this application!
3) Run 'python easy_trader.py'
